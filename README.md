# Customer-Churn-Prediction
I created an ANN model to predict customer churn using a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puja19/telcom-customer-churn). The model achieved an accuracy of 92 out of 100. The code is fully explained in the accompanying notebook.
I you want to run this code first install all the dependences which in given in the first cell of the jupyter notebook using pip3 install 'library-name'. then run the code this will be working  fine.
